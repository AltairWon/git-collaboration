Aloha, 

My name is Acacia Kahananui-Ward and in this text file I will describe my project.

I am going to create an app that is kind of a hybrid between Instagram and TripAdvisor. It will be an app where 
you can post on your own page your own travel experience and rate the places that you visit. When something is 
posted for a certain location it will also post to a page under that category or location if permitted by the user. 
From the posts that people leave, the user that leaves the posts can make it an option to let people connect with 
them so they can help other people prepare for their own trips. 
The three entities will be User, Reviews, and Location.
