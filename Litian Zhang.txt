Hi, this is Litian Zhang. I will describe my project idea in this file. 

The inspiration comes from online shopping. I want to create a website where people can share what products they like in their online shopping experience. 

Whereas this website does not do "shopping", but only sharing experiences. 

The three entities are user, product, and favorite. 

Users are who register and use the service. 

Products are created by users so that they can share how their online shopping experiences are. 

Favorites are categories of products, each user has a favorite, and they can add whatever products they like in their favorites. 

This is my idea for now, I hope it will work with our topic.
