Aloha, I am Ephraim Tacuban a senior from the Philippines majoring in Computer Science. I am also working in the Marketing Department of the Polynesian Cultural Center as an ECommerce Specialist. For my final project, I would like to continue my project about creating a webpage that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly here in BYU-H can easily fill out a move-in or move-out form to assist the ward clerks keep their ward records updated and are kept on track.
